A basic browser-based assembler built specifically for FPGA soft-core verification and embedded systems testing. 
The tool focuses on direct "bare-metal" assembly; generates raw machine code for instruction memory initialization. 
Two-pass resolution architecture for branches and labels, a "Pipeline Debug" mode for hazard injection, and native export for `.hex` and `.mif` formats
Currently supports  RV32I.
